1.What is a gitignore file and what should it include for a Java project? The .gitignore text file is a compilation of the set of files which should be ignored while committing to a project. These are commonly the Java complied class files, package files, Eclipse setup files and Log files.
2.What does fast-forward in Git mean?If the master hasn’t been modified the git will simply point the master to the latest remote branch  that was committed. This is called fast-forwarding.
3.Why should you have different branches?A project is developed by a team consisting of multiple people, and the chances of code breaking is directly proportional with the number persons in the team. To avoid such scenarios each developer is advised to create a remote branch through which he can push his changes. Moreover the development cycle happen concurrently and is followed by series of debugging and testing so the work done by one shouldn’t disrupt others work. Even at the worst case if any conflicts occurs when merging , it’s always easier to resolve it in the remote branch rather than of the master branch.4.In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have? Usually a project has only one remote repo, but having multiple repositories is not a mistake.reference :
